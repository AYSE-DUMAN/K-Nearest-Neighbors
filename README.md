# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository provides an implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm in Python. KNN is a simple, yet powerful, machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The repository includes the algorithm's implementation along with various examples and applications using different datasets.

## Overview

The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the closest training examples in the feature space. Given a new data point, KNN finds the `K` nearest neighbors and assigns the most common label (for classification) or average value (for regression) to the new point.

### Key Concepts:
- **Classification**: The most common class among the nearest neighbors is assigned to the data point.
- **Regression**: The average of the target values of the nearest neighbors is used for prediction.
- **Distance Metrics**: Commonly used distance metrics include **Euclidean distance**, **Manhattan distance**, and others.
- **Value of K**: The choice of `K` (number of neighbors) plays a critical role in the model's performance.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the KNN algorithm and evaluation metrics.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preparation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and result plotting.
